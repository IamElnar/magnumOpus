# Terminal File Manager

This is my first semester project for C++ programming. The goal of this project was to implement a terminal-based file manager with the following functionality:

## Features

### Basic File Operations
- **Support for file types**: regular files, directories, and symbolic links.
- **Basic operations**: 
  - Creating files and directories
  - Copying files
  - Moving files
  - Deleting files
- Perform the above operations on sets of files defined by regular expressions.

### Advanced Operations
- **Concatenation**: Combine multiple files into a single file.
- **Text search**: Search for files containing specific text within them.
- **Deduplication**: Identify duplicate files and replace duplicates with symbolic links to save space.

### User Interface
- Provides a simple user interface for terminal navigation.
- Displays the directory structure with visual distinctions between regular files, directories, and symbolic links.
- Allows navigation between directories using the terminal interface.

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my first semester coursework in **C++ Programming**. The primary objective was to create a file manager with basic and advanced file operations, including the ability to manage files using regular expressions and to optimize storage through file deduplication.
